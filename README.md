## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Per-User Data Storage**
  - Each user gets a folder in `saved_files/` named after their username.
  - All files are named like `{username}_csv_transactions.csv`, `{username}_budgets.txt`, etc.
- **Automatic File Management**
  - On registration/login, all required files are created if missing (with sensible defaults).
  - If you delete your files, they’re recreated on your next login.
- **No Data Leaks**
  - Every file read/write uses your own folder and file.
  - No global/shared files—guaranteed by code and repo structure.
- **GitHub Integration**
  - All changes are pushed to the repo for transparency and backup.
