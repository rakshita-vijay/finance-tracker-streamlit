## 6. Budget Recovery Roadmap

### Budget Analysis

*   **Monthly Budget:** $500.00
*   **Yearly Budget:** $6000.00
*   **Monthly Spent:** $550.00
*   **Yearly Spent:** $6600.00
*   **Monthly Consumed Percentage:** 110%
*   **Yearly Consumed Percentage:** 110%
*   **Overruns:** Dining Out ($50.00)
*   **Projected Year-End Position:** -$600.00
*   **Overspend Impact:** Overspending by $600 will reduce planned savings by the same amount.

Since the monthly budget was exceeded, here are two recovery plans:

**Plan A: Full Deduction from Next Month's Budget**

*   Deduct $50 from next month's budget, resulting in a budget of $450.

**3-Month Cash Flow Forecast (Plan A):**

| Month | Budget    | Projected Spending | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1     | $450.00   | $500.00            | -$50.00        |
| 2     | $500.00   | $500.00            | $0.00         |
| 3     | $500.00   | $500.00            | $0.00         |

**Annual Savings Impact (Plan A):** Assuming consistent spending, this plan recovers the $600 deficit by the end of the year, restoring planned savings.

**Plan B: Proportional Reduction Across Remaining Months**

*   Reduce the budget by $4.55 each month for the remaining 11 months ($50 / 11 = $4.5454...). New monthly budget: $495.45

**3-Month Cash Flow Forecast (Plan B):**

| Month | Budget    | Projected Spending | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|-----------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1     | $495.45   | $500.00            | -$4.55        |
| 2     | $495.45   | $500.00            | -$4.55        |
| 3     | $495.45   | $500.00            | -$4.55        |

**Annual Savings Impact (Plan B):** This plan also recovers the $600 deficit by the end of the year, albeit with a smaller monthly adjustment.

**Recommendation:**

Given the moderate liquidity risk, **Plan A** is recommended. While it requires a larger adjustment in the following month, it ensures a quicker return to the original budget and reduces the risk of prolonged overspending. Close monitoring of expenses is crucial to ensure adherence to the revised budget.
