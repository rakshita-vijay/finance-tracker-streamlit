### Recurring Expense Opportunities

| Expense          | Potential Savings | Recommendation                                                                                                |

### Budget Recovery Roadmap

*   **Monthly Budget:** $500.00
*   **Yearly Budget:** $6000.00
*   **Monthly Spend:** $550.00
*   **Yearly Spend:** $6600.00
*   **Percent Monthly Budget Consumed:** 110%
*   **Percent Yearly Budget Consumed:** 110%
*   **Budget Overruns by Category:**
    *   Entertainment: $50.00
*   **Year-End Financial Position Projection:** Projected to be over budget by $600.00 at year-end.
*   **Overspend Impact on Savings Goals:** Overspending will reduce annual savings goals by $600.00.

Since the monthly budget was exceeded, here are two recovery plans:

**Plan A: Full Deduction from Next Month's Budget**

*   Deduct the $50.00 overspend from next month's budget.
*   Next Month's Budget: $450.00

**3-Month Cash Flow Forecast (Plan A):**

| Month | Budget    | Projected Spend | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1     | $450.00   | $500.00         | -$50.00       |
| 2     | $500.00   | $500.00         | $0.00         |
| 3     | $500.00   | $500.00         | $0.00         |

**Plan B: Proportional Reduction Across Remaining Months**

*   Spread the $50.00 overspend across the remaining 11 months of the year.
*   Monthly Reduction: $50.00 / 11 = $4.55 (approximately)
*   Adjusted Monthly Budget: $500.00 - $4.55 = $495.45

**3-Month Cash Flow Forecast (Plan B):**

| Month | Budget      | Projected Spend | Net Cash Flow |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1     | $495.45    | $500.00         | -$4.55        |
| 2     | $495.45    | $500.00         | -$4.55        |
| 3     | $495.45    | $500.00         | -$4.55        |

**Annual Savings Impact:**

*   **Plan A:** Recovers the full $600 over the year if spending is kept at $500 for the remaining months.
*   **Plan B:** Reduces the monthly budget slightly, requiring consistent spending discipline to avoid further overspending.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the moderate liquidity risk profile, **Plan A** is recommended. While it requires a more significant adjustment in the short term, it provides a clearer path to budget recovery and reduces the risk of continued overspending. Closely monitor spending in the subsequent months to ensure adherence to the reduced budget.
